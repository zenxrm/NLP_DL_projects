# NLP Deep Learning Projects

This repository showcases a collection of applied **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** projects built using modern transformer-based models.  
The projects focus on solving **real-world problems** across domains such as mental health, psychology, education, and climate awareness.

Each project is implemented end-to-end using Python, combining classical NLP techniques with state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.
